## Programming in Prolog

### Chapter 1: Tutorial Introduction

#### Prolog
- Logical Computer Language
- Propositional and Predicate Logic
- Descriptive and Prescriptive
- Describing known facts and relationships about a problem
- Less Prescribe the sequence of steps taken by a computer to solve the problem
  
#### Objects and Relationships
- Objects and Relationships
- John owns the book
- - John and book are objects; owns is the relationship
- Object: refers to things that we can represent using terms

```
% this is a fact or a predicate
own(john, book)
```

#### Programming
Prolog consists of
<ol>
  <li>specifying some facts about objects and their relationships</li> % facts
  <li>defining some rules about objects and their relationships</li> % rules
  <li>asking questions about objects and their relationships</li> % query
</ol>

#### Facts
Example facts
```
% john likes mary
likes(john, mary)
% gold is valuable
valuable(gold)
% jane owns gold
own(jane, gold)
% john is father of jane
father(john, jane)
% john gives the book to mary
gives(john, book, mary)
```
- Each time a name is used, the name refers to a particular individual object.
```
likes(john, mary) % this is a fact
% likes is called a predicate
% john and mary are called arguments
% name and number of argument are arbitrary
```
- Collection of facts = database (according to Textbook) = knowledge base KB (according to Dr. Visit)

#### Questions
```
?- owns(mary, book)
% this is asking whether mary owns the book or not
% going to check in the KB
% if found, yes. if not found, no.
```

#### Variables
- Starts with Capital Letter e.g X, Y, Parent, Book, etc.
- A variable, such as X, does not name a particular
